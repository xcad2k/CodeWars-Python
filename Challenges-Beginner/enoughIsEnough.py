"""
TASK:

Given a list and a number n, create a new list that contains each number of list at most n times without reordering. For example if n=2, and the input is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drope the next [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times and then take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].

l = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
n = 2

'''
SOLUTION 1:
- Advantage: shorter code and lower storage costs
- Disadvantage: A runtime of Î˜(len(result)) to look up the current count 
'''

result = []

for x in l:
    if result.count(x) < n:
        result.append(x)

print(result)

'''
SOLUTION 2:
- Advantage: it scales better in case of runtime since the lookup of the current count is working in an average of O(1) now (amortized worst case is still O(n) (https://stackoverflow.com/a/1963529/8924689))
- Disadvantage: it takes more storage since you need another dict and the code gets a bit longer
